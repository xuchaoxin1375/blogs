    Invoke-WebRequest: The requested name is valid, but no data of the requested type was found.
    ```

### powershellÂëΩ‰ª§ËØ¶Ëß£

- The command `irm get.scoop.sh | iex` is used to install Scoop on a Windows system. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the command does:

  - `irm`: This is short for `Invoke-RestMethod`, a PowerShell cmdlet used for making HTTP requests. In this case, it's being used to download the installation script for Scoop from the URL `get.scoop.sh`.
  - `get.scoop.sh`: This is the URL where the installation script for Scoop is located.
  - `|`: This is a pipe symbol that is used to send the output of one command to another command. In this case, it's sending the output of the `irm` command (which is the installation script for Scoop) to the `iex` command.
  - `iex`: This is short for `Invoke-Expression`, another PowerShell cmdlet used for running commands or scripts as if they were typed directly into the command line. In this case, it's being used to execute the installation script for Scoop that was downloaded by the `irm` command.

  So, when you run the command `irm get.scoop.sh | iex`, it downloads the installation script for Scoop from `get.scoop.sh` using `Invoke-RestMethod` and then executes the script using `Invoke-Expression`. This will install Scoop on your Windows system.

  use_lessmsi: $true|$false
        Prefer lessmsi utility over native msiexec.
  
  no_junction: $true|$false
        The 'current' version alias will not be used. Shims and shortcuts will point to specific version instead.

        Git repository containining scoop source code.
        This configuration is useful for custom forks.
  
  scoop_branch: master|develop
        Allow to use different branch than master.
        Could be used for testing specific functionalities before released into all users.
        If you want to receive updates earlier to test new functionalities use develop (see: 'https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/issues/2939')
  
  proxy: [username:password@]host:port
        By default, Scoop will use the proxy settings from Internet Options, but with anonymous authentication.
  
        * To use the credentials for the current logged-in user, use 'currentuser' in place of username:password
        * To use the system proxy settings configured in Internet Options, use 'default' in place of host:port
        * An empty or unset value for proxy is equivalent to 'default' (with no username or password)
        * To bypass the system proxy and connect directly, use 'none' (with no username or password)
  
  autostash_on_conflict: $true|$false
        When a conflict is detected during updating, Scoop will auto-stash the uncommitted changes.
        (Default is $false, which will abort the update)
  
  default_architecture: 64bit|32bit|arm64
        Allow to configure preferred architecture for application installation.

  cat_style:
        When set to a non-empty string, Scoop will use 'bat' to display the manifest for
        the `scoop cat` command and while doing manifest review. This requires 'bat' to be
        installed (run `scoop install bat` to install it), otherwise errors will be thrown.
        The accepted values are the same as ones passed to the --style flag of 'bat'.
  
  ignore_running_processes: $true|$false
        When set to $false (default), Scoop would stop its procedure immediately if it detects
        any target app process is running. Procedure here refers to reset/uninstall/update.
        When set to $true, Scoop only displays a warning message and continues procedure.
  
  private_hosts:
        Array of private hosts that need additional authentication.
        For example, if you want to access a private GitHub repository,
        you need to add the host to this list with 'match' and 'headers' strings.

        Disable/Hold Scoop self-updates, until the specified date.
        `scoop hold scoop` will set the value to one day later.
