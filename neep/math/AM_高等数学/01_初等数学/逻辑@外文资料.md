  - [Negation ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation)

    - In logic, negation, also called the logical complement, is an operation that takes a proposition $P$ to another proposition "not $P$", standing for "$P$ is not true", written $\neg P$, ${\displaystyle {\mathord {\sim }}P}$ or $\overline{P}$. It is interpreted intuitively as being true when $P$ is false, and false when $P$ is true.
    - Negation is thus a unary logical connective. It may be applied as an operation on notions, propositions, truth values, or semantic values more generally. In classical logic, negation is normally identified with the truth function that takes truth to falsity (and vice versa). In intuitionistic logic, according to the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation, the negation of a proposition $P$ is the proposition whose proofs are the refutations of $P$.
    - 在逻辑学中，否定（negation），也称为逻辑补（logical complement），是一种将命题 $P$ 转换为另一个命题 "非 $P$" 的操作，表示 "$P$ 不为真"，写作 $\neg P$，${\displaystyle {\mathord {\sim }}P}$ 或 $\overline{P}$。直观地理解，当 $P$ 为假时，否定为真；当 $P$ 为真时，否定为假[1][2]。因此，否定是一种一元逻辑连接词。它可以作为概念、命题、真值或更一般的语义值的操作应用。在经典逻辑中，否定通常被认为是将真转换为假（反之亦然）的真值函数。在直观主义逻辑中，根据布劳威尔-海廷-科尔莫戈洛夫解释，命题 $P$ 的否定是其证明为 $P$ 的反驳的命题。

    - In logic and mathematics, contraposition refers to the inference of going from a conditional statement into its logically equivalent contrapositive, and an associated proof method known as proof by contraposition. 

    - The contrapositive of a statement has its **antecedent**(前件) and **consequent**(后件) inverted and flipped.

    - Conditional statement $P\rightarrow Q$. In formulas: the contrapositive of $P\rightarrow Q$ is $\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$.

    - If P, Then Q. — If not Q, Then not P. "If it is raining, then I wear my coat" — "If I don't wear my coat, then it isn't raining."

    - The law of contraposition says that a conditional statement is true if, and only if, its contrapositive is true.
      The contrapositive ($\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$) can be compared with three other statements:
      Inversion (the inverse), $\neg P \rightarrow \neg Q$

    - "If it is not raining, then I don't wear my coat." Unlike the contrapositive, the inverse's truth value is not at all dependent on whether or not the original proposition was true, as evidenced here.
      Conversion (the converse), $Q \rightarrow P$

    - "If I wear my coat, then it is raining." The converse(逆命题) is actually the contrapositive of the inverse([英]否命题), and so always has the same truth value as the **inverse** (which as stated earlier does not always share the same truth value as that of the original proposition).

    - Negation (the logical complement), $\neg (P \rightarrow Q)$(命题的否定,区别于否命题,国内将Negation作为否命题)

      - "It is not the case that if it is raining then I wear my coat.", or equivalently, "Sometimes, when it is raining, I don't wear my coat. " 
      - If the negation is true, then the original proposition (and by extension the contrapositive) is false.
      - Note that if $P\rightarrow Q$ is true and one is given that $Q$ is false (i.e., $\neg Q$), then it can logically be concluded that $P$ must be also false (i.e., $\neg P$). This is often called the law of contrapositive, or <u>the modus tollens</u> rule of inference.
      - [否定后件 modus tollens(wikipedia.org)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/否定後件)

    - 在逻辑学和数学中，contrapositoin指的是从一个条件语句推导出其逻辑等价的逆命题的过程，以及一个相关的证明方法，即换质换位法。

    - 一个命题的逆命题是把**前件和后件**颠倒并反转。

      条件语句 $P\rightarrow Q$。用公式表示：$P\rightarrow Q$ 的逆命题是 $\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$。

    - 如果 P，那么 Q。—— 如果非 Q，那么非 P。"如果下雨，那么我穿外套" —— "如果我不穿外套，那么就不是在下雨。"

    - 反对称定律表明，一个条件语句是真的当且仅当其逆命题是真的。

    - 逆命题 ($\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$) 可以与另外三个命题进行比较：

    - 反转 (逆命题)，$\neg P \rightarrow \neg Q$

      "如果不下雨，那么我不穿外套。" 与逆命题不同的是，逆命题的真值与原命题的真值无关，如此例所示。

    - 转换 (转换)，$Q \rightarrow P$

      "如果我穿外套，那么就在下雨。" 转换实际上是逆命题的逆命题，因此总是与逆命题具有相同的真值（正如前面所述，它并不总是与原命题具有相同的真值）。

    - 否定 (逻辑补语)，$\neg (P \rightarrow Q)$

      - "不是这种情况：如果下雨，那么我穿外套。" 或等价于 "有时，当下雨时，我不穿外套。" 

      - 如果否定为真，那么原命题（以及相应的逆命题）为假。

      - 注意，如果 $P\rightarrow Q$ 为真，而给定 $Q$ 为假 (即，$\neg Q$)，那么可以逻辑地得出 $P$ 也必须为假 (即，$\neg P$)。这通常被称为反对称定律或推理的 modus tollens 规则

  - [Converse (logic)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_(logic))

    - 逆命题
    - In logic and mathematics, the converse of a categorical or implicational statement is the result of reversing its two constituent statements.
    - For the implication P → Q, the converse is Q → P. For the categorical proposition All S are P, the converse is All P are S. Either way, the truth of the converse is generally independent from that of the original statement.
    - 在逻辑和数学中，范畴性或蕴含性语句的逆命题是将其两个组成语句颠倒的结果。对于蕴含命题 P → Q，其逆命题为 Q → P。对于范畴命题“所有的 S 都是 P”，其逆命题为“所有的 P 都是 S”。无论哪种情况，逆命题的真实性通常与原始语句的真实性无关。

  - [Inverse (logic) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_(logic))

    - 国内教材是逆命题(国外则表示否命题)
    - In logic, an inverse is a type of conditional sentence which is an immediate inference made from another conditional sentence. More specifically, given a conditional sentence of the form ${\displaystyle P\rightarrow Q}$, the inverse refers to the sentence ${\displaystyle \neg P\rightarrow \neg Q}$. Since an inverse is the contrapositive of the converse, inverse and converse are logically equivalent to each other.
    - 在逻辑学中，否命题是从另一个条件语句中进行的直接推论的一种类型的条件语句。更具体地说，给定形式为 ${\displaystyle P\rightarrow Q}$ 的条件语句，逆命题指的是 ${\displaystyle \neg P\rightarrow \neg Q}$ 这个语句。由于逆命题是逆命题和逆命题的逆命题，因此逆命题和逆命题在逻辑上是等价的。

  - [Obversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obversion)

    - In [traditional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_logic), **obversion** is a "type of [immediate inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_inference) in which from a given [proposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition) another proposition is inferred whose subject is the same as the original subject, whose predicate is the contradictory of the original predicate, and whose quality is affirmative if the original proposition's quality was negative and vice versa". The quality of the inferred [categorical proposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_proposition) is changed but the [truth value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_value) is the same to the original proposition. 
    - The immediately inferred proposition is termed the "obverse" of the original proposition, and is a valid form of inference for all types (A, E, I, O) of categorical propositions.
    - 在传统逻辑中，倒换是一种"立即推理类型，从给定的命题推断出另一个命题，其主体与原始主体相同，谓词与原始谓词相矛盾，质量为肯定的，如果原命题的质量为否定的，反之亦然" 。
    - 推断出的范畴命题的质量发生了变化，但真值与原命题相同。立即推断出的命题被称为原命题的"倒置"，对于所有类型（A，E，I，O）的范畴命题来说，这是一种有效的推理形式。

  - [Transposition (logic)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_(logic))

    - In propositional logic, transposition  is a valid rule of replacement that permits one to switch the antecedent with the consequent of a conditional statement in a logical proof if they are also both negated. It is the inference from the truth of "A implies B" to the truth of "Not-B implies not-A", and conversely.  It is very closely related to the rule of inference modus tollens. It is the rule that:
      - ${\displaystyle (P\to Q)\Leftrightarrow (\neg Q\to \neg P)}$
      - where "$\Leftrightarrow$" is a metalogical symbol representing "can be replaced in a proof with".
    - 在命题逻辑中，换位是一种有效的替换规则，它允许在逻辑证明中将条件语句的前件与后件互换，前提是它们都被否定。从"A蕴含B"的真实性推断出"非B蕴含非A"的真实性，反之亦然.它与推理规则假言拒谏法非常密切相关。换位规则为：$( {\displaystyle (P\to Q)\Leftrightarrow (\neg Q\to \neg P)})$其中"$( \Leftrightarrow)$"是一个元逻辑符号，表示"可以在证明中互相替换"。

### categorical proposition@AEIO

- [Categorical proposition - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_proposition)

- In logic, a categorical proposition, or categorical statement, is a proposition that asserts or denies that all or some of the members of one category (the subject term) are included in another (the predicate term).[1] The study of arguments using categorical statements (i.e., syllogisms) forms an important branch of deductive reasoning that began with the Ancient Greeks.

- The Ancient Greeks such as Aristotle identified four primary distinct types of categorical proposition and gave them standard forms (now often called A, E, I, and O). 

- If, abstractly, the subject category is named **S** and the predicate category is named **P**, the four **standard forms** are:

  - All S are P. (A form, ${\displaystyle \forall {x}[S_{x}\rightarrow P_{x}]\equiv \forall {x}[\neg S_{x}\lor P_{x}]}$)

  - No S are P. (E form, ${\displaystyle \forall {x}[S_{x}\rightarrow \neg P_{x}]\equiv \forall {x}[\neg S_{x}\lor \neg P_{x}]}$)

  - Some S are P. (I form, ${\displaystyle \exists {x}[S_{x}\land P_{x}]}$)

  - Some S are not P. (O form, ${\displaystyle \exists {x}[S_{x}\land \neg P_{x}]}$)

- Surprisingly, a large number of sentences may be translated into one of these canonical forms while retaining all or most of the original meaning of the sentence. Greek investigations resulted in the so-called square of opposition, which codifies the logical relations among the different forms; for example, that an A-statement is contradictory to an O-statement; that is to say, for example, if one believes "All apples are red fruits," one cannot simultaneously believe that "Some apples are not red fruits." Thus the relationships of the square of opposition may allow immediate inference, whereby the truth or falsity of one of the forms may follow directly from the truth or falsity of a statement in another form.

- Modern understanding of categorical propositions (originating with the mid-19th century work of George Boole) requires one to consider if the subject category may be empty. If so, this is called the hypothetical viewpoint, in opposition to the existential viewpoint which requires the subject category to have at least one member. The existential viewpoint is a stronger stance than the hypothetical and, when it is appropriate to take, it allows one to deduce more results than otherwise could be made. The hypothetical viewpoint, being the weaker view, has the effect of removing some of the relations present in the traditional square of opposition.
- Arguments consisting of three categorical propositions — two as premises and one as conclusion — are known as categorical syllogisms and were of paramount importance from the times of ancient Greek logicians through the Middle Ages. Although formal arguments using categorical syllogisms have largely given way to the increased expressive power of modern logic systems like the first-order predicate calculus, they still retain practical value in addition to their historic and pedagogical significance.

- | Name |     English Sentence     |  Standard Form   |
  | :--: | :----------------------: | :--------------: |
  | *A*  | All cats have four legs. |   All S is P.    |
  | *E*  | No cats have eight legs. |    No S is P.    |
  | *I*  |  Some cats are orange.   |   Some S is P.   |
  | *O*  | Some cats are not black. | Some S is not P. |

### 直接推理immediate inference

- An immediate inference is an inference which can be made from only one statement or proposition.[1] For instance, from the statement "All toads are green", the immediate inference can be made that "no toads are not green" or "no toads are non-green" (Obverse). There are a number of immediate inferences which can validly be made using logical operations, the result of which is a logically equivalent statement form to the given statement. There are also invalid immediate inferences which are syllogistic fallacies.

- 立即推理是一种只能从一个陈述或命题中得出的推理。例如，从陈述 "所有蟾蜍都是绿色的"，可以立即推断出 "没有蟾蜍不是绿色的" 或 "没有蟾蜍是非绿色的"（正反命题）。

- 通过使用逻辑运算，可以有效地进行许多立即推理，其结果是与给定陈述在逻辑上等价的陈述形式。还有一些无效的立即推理，它们是三论谬误。

  

- 直接推理是日常语言和亚里士多德的词项逻辑中常见的基本推理形式。

- 不同于从两个直言命题得出一个直言命题的直言三段论，它从一个直言命题得出另一个直言命题，所以被称为是直接的。

- 在传统逻辑中主要有换质法（Obversion）、换位法（Conversion）和对置法（Contraposition）。

- Converse🎈

  Given a type E statement, "No S are P.", one can make the immediate inference that "No P are S" which is the converse of the given statement.

  Given a type I statement, "Some S are P.", one can make the immediate inference that "Some P are S" which is the converse of the given statement.

- Obverse🎈

  Given a type A statement, "All S are P.", one can make the immediate inference that "No S are non-P" which is the obverse of the given statement.

  Given a type E statement, "No S are P.", one can make the immediate inference that "All S are non-P" which is the obverse of the given statement.

  Given a type I statement, "Some S are P.", one can make the immediate inference that "Some S are not non-P" which is the obverse of the given statement.

  Given a type O statement, "Some S are not P.", one can make the immediate inference that "Some S are non-P" which is the obverse of the given statement.

- Contrapositive🎈
  Given a type A statement, "All S are P.", one can make the immediate inference that "All non-P are non-S" which is the contrapositive of the given statement.
  Given a type O statement, "Some S are not P.", one can make the immediate inference that "Some non-P are not non-S" which is the contrapositive of the given statement.

### transposition vs contrasposition

#### Differences between transposition and contraposition

- [Differences between transposition and contraposition wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_(logic)#Differences_between_transposition_and_contraposition)

- Note that the method of **transposition** and **contraposition** should not be confused. Contraposition is a type of [immediate inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_inference) in which from a given categorical proposition another categorical proposition is inferred which has as its subject the **contradictory** of the original predicate. Since nothing is said in the definition of contraposition with regard to the predicate of the inferred proposition, it is permissible that it could be the original subject or its contradictory. This is in contradistinction to the form of the propositions of transposition, which may be material implication, or a hypothetical statement. The difference is that in its application to categorical propositions the result of contraposition is two contrapositives, each being the obvert of the other,  i.e. "No non-P is S" and "All non-P is non-S". The distinction between the two contrapositives is absorbed and eliminated in the principle of transposition, which presupposes the "mediate inferences" of contraposition and is also referred to as the "law of contraposition".

- 在逻辑学中，transposition（转换）和contraposition（对换）是两个不同的概念，它们都涉及到命题之间的关系。

  1. Transposition（转换）：转换是一种推理规则，它涉及到条件命题（即 "如果 P，那么 Q"）的关系。在转换中，我们可以从一个条件命题推导出另一个条件命题，即 "如果非 Q，那么非 P"。换句话说，转换是将原始条件命题的结果（Q）否定，并将原始条件命题的前提（P）否定。这种关系在命题逻辑中被认为是等价的，即原始条件命题和它的转换命题具有相同的真值。
  2. Contraposition（对换）：对换也是一种推理规则，它涉及到分类命题（如 "所有 A 是 B"）的关系。在对换中，我们可以从一个分类命题推导出另一个分类命题，即 "所有非 B 是非 A"。这意味着我们将原始命题的谓词（B）否定，并将原始命题的主题（A）否定。在分类命题中，原始命题和它的对换命题也被认为是等价的。

  总之，transposition（转换）和contraposition（对换）都是关于命题之间关系的推理规则，但它们分别应用于条件命题和分类命题。在应用这些规则时，我们需要注意它们的适用范围和推理过程。

####  How does Transposition differ from Contraposition?

- [logic - How does Transposition differ from Contraposition? - Philosophy Stack Exchange](https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/31073/how-does-transposition-differ-from-contraposition)
- 在亚里士多德逻辑中，区别在于对偶命题是范畴命题，而不是假设命题。
- Within aristotelean logic, the difference is that a contrapositive is a categorical, rather than a hypothetical. 
- the contrapositive of the categorical "all A are B" is the categorical "all non-B are non-A". 
- The term transposition is reserved for hypotheticals, so "if A then B" transposes to "if not B then not A".
- 在谓词逻辑中，这种区别并不重要，因为像“所有的A都是B”这样的命题被解释为**假设命题**，即“对于任何x，如果x是A，则x是B”。
- 这是与亚里士多德逻辑的处理方式的重要区别，因为这意味着“所有的A都是B”没有**存在性**的含义，即它不假设任何A存在。
- 因此，如果没有A，"所有的A都是B"是显然成立的，"所有的A都是B"不说明"一些A是B"。
